            <h2>Netflix Analysis and Recommendations</h2>
            <p>
                Using the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows" target="_blank">here</a>, where the goal was to uncover insights into Netflix's content and trends over the years.
                In the notebook, I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and viisualization to gain insights into the distribution of Movie and TV shows, content added over the years, the kinds of contents being added and more. After the analysis is done, I build a recommendation system using
                TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to calculate the similarity between the movies and shows to recommend users shows/movies based on what they like. Finally, I deployed my model to huggingface spaces and build a simple interface for users to get recommendations. Link to the space is
                <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/bhh97/Netflix_Recommendations" target="_blank">here</a> and you can find the link to the project below.

            <h2>HDB Resale Prices Analysis and Prediction</h2>
            <p>
                This is my own project to analyze HDB resale prices in Singapore. In the notebook, I delve into factors that affect housing pricing such as location, flat type, number of lease years remaining, size of flat, and what storey the HDB resides in.
                At the end of the analysis, I created a predictive model to predict housing pricing and deployed the model into huggingface spaces. Link to the space is

            <p>
                Using the dog breeds image dataset found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/70-dog-breedsimage-data-set" target="_blank">here</a>, I created a simple machine learning model to predict the breed of the dog when a picture of a dog is uploaded. I uploaded the model 
                into huggingface spaces where users can upload images of dogs and the model will give the prediction of the dog breed as output. Link to the space can be found <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/bhh97/dog_breed_pred" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <h2>Face Recognition Project</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, I've worked on developing a facial recognition model using the InceptionResNetV1 architecture. Leveraging on datasets like Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and Asian Faces Dataset (AFD), 
                the model is trained to identify and verify faces with precision. The key accomplishment of this project is its ability to recognize new faces it was not exposed to during training. 
                The model is implemented with PyTorch.

                I perform a detailed EDA to uncover trends and relationships in factors like BMI, blood pressure, and more. With the insights gained, I trained the data on multiple models to find out which models are more effective in predicting diabetes likelihood.

                Using the superconductivity dataset from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/464/superconductivty+data" target="_blank">UCI</a>, 
                where the goal is to predict critical temperature based on features extracted. Not knowing anything about the data as I have no domain knowledge in the field of superconductivity, I utilize Random Forest Regressor to determine the important features in the dataset
                and afterwards, creating an ANN model to make predictions on the test set.

            <h2>Predicting Credit Defaulters</h2>
            <p>
                Using the Credit Risk dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, 
                the goal is to predict whether a customer will deafult on their loan. For this project, I used Apache Spark to predict loan defaults. Firstly, I explored various demographic and financial features to assess the probability of loan defaults. 
                My approach integrates data preprocessing and feature engineering in Apache Spark, followed by training a logistic regression model to discern the subtle patterns that indicate risk. 
                The project's cornerstone is the model's capability to accurately gauge creditworthiness, a key metric in the financial sector.
